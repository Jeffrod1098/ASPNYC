### ASPNYC 
### Project Description
This is a notifier web app, every morning it will email/text you the latest alternate side parking rules for the day in NYC. You can create an account and choose how and when you would like to be notified. I decided to create this app so that there is a seamless way to get informed on the street cleaning days, no longer have to go on a website or call 311 to find this info out, you will be notified every morning.

### Wire Frame

### User Stories
As a user I would like to get notified every weekday morning to see if street cleaning will be happening on the specified day, that way  I wonâ€™t have to go through the process of looking up if street cleaning is on schedule due to weather, holiday, and or other circumstances. This app will notify me in the morning otherwise. I would also like the ability to remove my info from the system if need be. I would also like the ability to see if my info is already in the system.

### Technologies Used

Deployment Tool: Azure

Front End: Angular(TypeScript), Tailwind CSS

Back End: .Net (C#), Cosmos Db (No SQL)

### Goals
Have a page where users can add and remove email/ phone info. Notify users every morning via text or email about NYC street cleaning rules for the day. Get this info from Twitter API, and use the NYC Street cleaning account to supply the info for the day. Store the data from Twitter API call in Db, and wipe every week.
